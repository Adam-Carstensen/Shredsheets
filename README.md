# Shredsheets
Shredsheets, the most useful spreadsheet ever created!  Also, so apps and stuff.  Finally open source!

---

Shredsheets is for understanding music theory applied to guitar, bass, ukulele, or anything with frets.  

Fully dynamic and adaptive fretboard models teach scales and modes intuitively with special emphasis on harmony and understanding.

Alternate tunings can be understood in moments; chords move up and down the neck like a seasoned jazz pro; scales instantly make sense and modes naturally follow.

Shredsheets codifies years of practice and study.  Repeating patterns and irregularities which you've stored away as "cool riffs" start to make sense in a deep and persistent way.  Each user I've spoken with describes different moments of enlightenment when THEY finally "got it".  

When you close Shredsheets and walk away.  You'll still "get it".  After using this application, your musical "life" will never be the same.  I promise.

In fact I'd wager that I can teach every guitarist on the planet SOMETHING with Shredsheets.  I may not know it myself, but I'd still be able to derive it with Shredsheets!
