			<h2>Shredsheets</h2>
		</header>

		<p>
			Imagine your guitar, bass, or any fretted instrument lying on your lap, the direction you'd normally hold it.
			<br />
			The top row is the first string (high e) and the bottom row is the sixth string (low E).
			<br />
			The left column is open strings, the next is the first fret, and so on.
			<br />
			The fretboard's content is dynamic and changes with your settings!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>The default key is C Major</b>
			<br />
			<i>
				Key of C
				<br />
				Major scale (Diatonic)
				<br />
				Ionian mode (Major)
			</i>

		</p>

		<p>
			If a fret is filled in with text, then it's a note in the selected key, scale, mode, and tuning!
			<br />
			If a fret is blacked out it's not a part of the scale; it's considered an "accidental", which can sound interesting or undesirable.
		</p>

			<h2>Home</h2>
		</header>

		<p>
			Hitting the back button will return you to the Shredsheets home page.
			<br />
			On the home page you have shortcuts to the most common settings (guitar, bass, ukulele), C Major, A Minor, and E Pentatonic Minor.
		</p>

		<header>
			<h2>Menu</h2>
		</header>

		<p> 
			A single tap on the fretboard opens the options menu.
			<br />
			If you want to play in C Minor, change the mode to Aolian (Minor). 
			<br />
			Notice the fretboard changing as you switch modes!  It changes in a similar way when you change keys.  You can do this through the menu or by swiping on the fretboard!
		</p>

		<header>
			<h2>Colors</h2>
		</header>

		<p> 
			The colors represent scale degrees.
			<br />
			Scale degrees are the steps of the selected scale's intervals, starting at the selected mode and circling back around again.
		</p>

			<h3>What does this mean, and what's it for?</h3>
		</header>
		<p>
			<b></b>
			You've probably hummed or heard hummed a song much higher or lower than it should be, but it was still instantly recognized. 
			<br />
			This is because we value the difference between notes much more than the actual notes themselves!
			<br />
			The colors are tied to those scale degrees!
			<br /><br />
			Blue is the 1st, Yellow is the 3rd, and Green is the 5th
			<br />
			Purple (light to dark) is the 2nd, 4th, and 6th
			<br />
			Pink is the 7th
		</p>

		<p>
		The 1st, 3rd, and 5th intervals are grouped because they're used to build major or minor chords.  These are the most common chords and are the core of western music.
		<br /><br />
		The 2nd, 4th, and 6th get grouped together because they share similar intervals to 1st, 3rd, and 5th and are often used as decorative degrees, changing the tone and character of the chord.
		<br /><br />
		7th gets pink because it's fabulous!
		<br />
		It really is!  The 7th is the leading tone which is used to create progressions.  It's a very tense note, which means that it needs resolution.  The use of flowing, relaxing, consonance (opposite of dissonance) with transitions into dissonance give jazz it's characteristic sound.

			<h2>Scale Degrees and Fretboard Steps</h2>
		</header>

		<p>
			The degrees of a scale are deduced by using the scale's intervals, starting at the position of the selected mode. 
			<br />
			An interval is the number of frets (or steps) moved from the previous position.
			<br />
			For example, the Major scale's (Diatonic (7 tones)) intervals are:
			<br />
			2 frets, 2 frets, 1 fret, 2 frets, 2 frets, 2 frets, and finally 1 fret to return to the root.
			<br />
			This is simplified as 2,2,1,2,2,2,1.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Ionian (Major) is the 1st mode of the Major scale and has the intervals:<br />2,2,1,2,2,2,1</li>
			<li>Dorian is the 2nd mode<br />2,1,2,2,2,1,2</li>
			<li>Phyrigian is the 3rd mode<br />1,2,2,2,1,2,2</li>
			<li>Lydian is the 4th mode<br />2,2,2,1,2,2,1</li>
			<li>Mixolydian is the 5th mode<br />2,2,1,2,2,1,2</li>
			<li>Aolian (Minor) is the 6th mode<br />2,1,2,2,1,2,2</li>
			<li>Locrian is the 7th and final mode of the Major scale<br />1,2,2,1,2,2,2</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Continuing, we see that the 8th mode (were there one) would end at the same 2,2,1,2,2,2,1 intervals that the first mode has, thus we simply circle around to the 1st mode again. 
			<br />
			In this manner, the modes loop like a dial.
			<br />
			The keys do the same thing, looping from C through D, E, F, G, A, B, and returning to C.
